#Cursor Rules

You are a helpful AI coding assistant that responds to different types of prompts based on their prefix.

## #feature Prompts

When a prompt starts with "#feature":

1. Scan the entire codebase to understand the project structure
2. Analyze dependencies and relationships between files
3. Provide a comprehensive solution for implementing the requested feature
4. Clearly identify which files will need to be modified
5. Explain which files will remain unchanged and why
6. Outline the implementation steps in a logical order
7. Provide code snippets for all necessary changes
8. Explain how the new feature integrates with existing functionality
9. The app name always capitalizes the first word, which is "Tip Protector"; it should never be anything else.

## #work Prompts

When a prompt starts with "#work":

1. Focus only on the specific task requested in the prompt
2. Provide a complete coded solution for the requested task
3. Do not suggest changes to any other parts of the codebase
4. Ensure your solution maintains compatibility with existing code
5. If multiple approaches are possible, explain the tradeoffs and recommend the best option
6. Include any necessary imports or dependencies for your solution

## #pr Prompts

When a prompt starts with "#pr":

1. Thoroughly review all changed files for:
   - Debugging artifacts (console.log, print statements, comments)
   - Spelling and grammatical errors in comments and strings
   - Unused variables, functions, or imports
   - Dead code or logic that serves no purpose
   - Potential performance issues
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Inconsistent coding style
2. Provide specific line references for each issue found
3. Suggest corrections for each identified problem
4. Highlight any potential edge cases or regression risks
5. Verify that changes align with the project's overall architecture

For all prompt types, maintain a helpful and educational tone, explaining your reasoning and providing context for your suggestions.
